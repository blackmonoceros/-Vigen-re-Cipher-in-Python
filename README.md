# -Vigenere-Cipher-in-Python
The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning it uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the text. 
It is an improvement over simpler ciphers like the Caesar cipher and is considered more secure due to its use of a repeating key.


The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning it uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the text. 
It is an improvement over simpler ciphers like the Caesar cipher and is considered more secure due to its use of a repeating key.

Here’s how the cipher works step by step:

Key Preparation:
The user provides a key (a word or phrase) that will determine the encryption pattern.

The key is repeated or truncated to match the length of the plaintext.


Encryption Process:
Each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a number of positions in the alphabet, determined by the corresponding letter in the key.
For example, if the key letter is 'B', the plaintext letter is shifted by 1 position (since 'B' is the second letter of the alphabet).


Handling Case and Non-Alphabetic Characters:
Uppercase and lowercase letters are treated separately.
Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are not encrypted and remain unchanged.


Result:
The encrypted text (ciphertext) is generated by combining all the shifted letters.

How the Code Works ?



Input:

The user provides the plaintext (plain_text) and the encryption key (key).


Key Handling:
The key is converted to uppercase to simplify calculations.
The key is used cyclically, meaning if the plaintext is longer than the key, the key starts over from the beginning.


Encryption:

For each letter in the plaintext:
The shift is calculated based on the corresponding letter in the key.
The letter is shifted within the alphabet (wrapping around if necessary).
Non-alphabetic characters are added to the result without modification.


Output:
The encrypted text is displayed as the result.


Example:

Input:

Plaintext: HELLO WORLD
Key: KEY
Process:
The key is repeated to match the length of the plaintext: KEYKEYKEYKE.
Each letter of the plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding letter in the key:
H (shifted by K) → R
E (shifted by E) → I
L (shifted by Y) → J
And so on...
Output:
Encrypted text: RIJVS UYVJN
